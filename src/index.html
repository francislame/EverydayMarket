		10/1/2024
		> Started working on assignment 3.
		> STEP 1: Revisited and created a copy of the everyday-market-ng Angular project for assignment 1.
		> STEP 2: Created the RegisterPageComponent component in CoreModule.
			• Created it by entering 'ng generate component core/register-page' on terminal.
			• Modifed core.module.ts:
				- Imported the new component.
				- Declared the new component.
				- Added as an export.
			• Modified register-page.component.ts with the necessary components for the user's submission.
			• Modified register-page.component.html with the ngSubmit code.
			• Encountered Error: TS-996002, deleted the RegisterPageComponent from app.module.ts.
			• Encountered Error: NG8002, modified core.module.ts with the following:
				- import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
				- imports: [
					CommonModule,
					FormsModule
					],
		> Created a "Register Now!" button on header.component.html.
		> Created image "main-areaBG.png", updated background on the main-area.

		10/2/2024
		> STEP 3: Setting up routes on CoreModule, MarketModule, and app.routing.module.ts.
			• Routing the "Register Here" button to /register for a clear path for the user.
				- Created core-routing.module.ts as the routing path for CoreModule.
				- Encountered Error: TS-996002, moved core.module.ts to src/app/core.
				- Encountered Error: TS-996007, cleaned up duplicated imports from app.module.ts and core.module.ts.
			• Modified app-routing.module.ts:
				- import { RegisterPageComponent } from './core/register-page/register-page.component';
				- const routes: Routes = [
					{ path: 'register', component: RegisterPageComponent },
					];
				- Encountered an issue where the Register form is not showing up when re-routing to localhost:4200/register, fixed by adding <router-outlet></router-outlet> on the index.html.
				- Encountered an issue where the Register button is not calling the Register form, moved the Register button to app.component.html instead of the header.
		> Creating a /home page so that the main page will only show routes to /products or /register.
			• ng generate component core/home-page
				- Modified the routing from the home-page to /products or /register by adding buttons asking the user to choose.
				- Deleted the Register Now button from app.component.html.
				- Deleted the Product categories from the home-page.
				- Created a home button on the header.component that links back to the home-page.

		10/3/2024
		> STEP 4: Updated the registration form with the details provided on the assignment.
			• Modified the register-page.component.ts to have the following:
				- Name: string, minimum 5 letters.
				- Email Address: string, must have valid email format (email@domain.com)
				- Phone Number: 10-digit number.
				- Date of Birth: yyyy-mm-dd
				- Street Address: letters, numbers, or spaces.
				- Province: dropdown showing Canadian provinces.
				- Country: dropdown showing the US or Canada, can only proceed if Canada is selected.
				- T&C Checkbox: must be checked in order to proceed.
				- Submit button that only enables once all of the conditions above is met.
		> STEP 5: Validators.
			• Created a 'validators' folder under the register-page folder.
			• Created custom-validations.ts, modified it's contents to have custom validations for name, phone number, and country.
				- Encountered Error: NG8002, resolved by modifying the custom-validators to be imported to register-page.component.html
			• Encountered an issue where the registration form doesn't turn on the css for solid red even if it was touched/dirty.
				- Cause of the issue was the name on the css was .invalid, rather than .is-invalid.
			• Email validator is not working properly to match the email format of email@email.com.
				- Modified the register-page.component.html's email validation rules to have "pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$""
			• Final testing to make sure that everything is running smoothly.
